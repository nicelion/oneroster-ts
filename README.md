# oneroster-ts (WIP)

> A TypeScript-first toolkit for working with **OneRoster v1.1 / v1.2 data** — including **CSV parsing, validation, writing, and realistic data generation**.

This library provides a simple and strongly-typed way to:

- Validate OneRoster CSV and JSON payloads
- Parse CSV fields into proper TypeScript structures
- Write CSV files that conform to the OneRoster spec
- Generate fake but spec-compliant OneRoster data for testing

Designed for:

- SIS integrations
- District ingest pipelines
- EdTech APIs
- Test data seeders
- Local import/export tooling

WORK IN PROGRESS
